                    Hello Everyone,<br>
                    My name is Gage D'Orlando, I'm 23, from Richmond, Va, and I'm the vice president of the Web Design and Development Society.<br>
                    A few interesting things about me is that I've been learning Web Development since 2018, I love rock climbing, and I have 3 guitars at school for some reason.<br>
                    I know I don't need that many but I have a problem.

                <h2>Web Development</h2>
                <p>
                    I started doing Web Development in high school with dreamweaver, but then decided I wanted to learn to code by hand. I then made my own gaming website, and almost failed my classes because I was so obsessed with coding my website. I had about 1000 daily users and loved the fun of learning new things. I then took a certificate course for full stack development at University of Richmond, and learned to use Node.JS, React.JS, some MongoDb, and Express.JS (this is called the MERN stack, it isn't used in Virginia). I then realized I needed a degree so I started working on my Bachelors in Web Development.
                </p>
                <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
                <p>
                    I love rock climbing way too much. I orignally just watched youtube videos of other people doing it, but then I saw that an elders quorum activity was rock climbing. I went out at 6am, and found out it was just the elders quorum president who liked it. I started climbing with him and was hooked instantly. Now I try to climb at least twice a week, and more if I can.
                </p>
                <h2>Guitar</h2>
                <p>
                    I've been playing guitar since I was about 15, but didn't really get into it until I joined a back about 2 years ago. Since then I've started playing almost everyday, and turns out you get a lot better if you do that.

                <h2>Highschool</h2>
                <p>In highschool my experience was pretty limited, I only knew what we were being taught in dreamweaver, which I found out was very out dated. It still used things like iFrames, and tables, which aren't really used anymore (for the most part). Because of this my first site was pretty janky and lack luster, but it was the most popular gaming site for the chromebooks at my highschool. I learned very little javascript just from what I googled online, but otherwise it was a very basic site.</p>
                <h2>University of Richmond</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot more at University of Richmond right away. I had never even heard of a wireframe before going there. We got straight into css libraries like Bootstrap (if you haven't used it, look into it, it makes styling and understanding modern css with the grid system so much easier). We then jumped into simple javascript sites like hangman and memory, and even learned to use firebase to make a multiplayer rock, paper, scissors site. Learning Node.JS actually made so much more possible on a web page, especially with all the modules that are availible. With that came Express, which didn't feel like it added that much to me, but I think it was for a lack of understanding of the difference between the two. Finally we learned ReactJS which is my favorite framework. It makes the work of making web pages so much faster in my opinion, but the learning curve is no joke. Finally we did some databasing, with some SQL and some MongoDb, but I didn't have much interest for it at the time so I don't really remember any of it. Either way, the experience I got at University of Richmond defintely fueled my love of Web Development so much.</p>
